# Node-Express-Handlebars

## Eat-Da-Burger!
Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.

## Motivation
Whenever a user submits a burger's name, this app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.

Each burger in the waiting area also has a `Devour it!` button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.

## Tech/framework used
MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM.


## Installation
    * npm install express-handlebars
    * npm install mysql
    * npm install express


## Credits
Based off of TA Paul's example
